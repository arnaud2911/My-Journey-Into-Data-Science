# Comprehensive Data Analysis of a Large E-commerce Dataset

## Project Description

This capstone project involves analyzing a large synthetic e-commerce transactions dataset to extract meaningful insights and actionable information. The project demonstrates data cleaning, manipulation, aggregation, and visualization techniques on a dataset that simulates real-world big data scenarios.

## Objectives

- **Data Generation**: Programmatically generate a large synthetic e-commerce dataset with anomalies and missing values.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- **Data Manipulation**: Perform data validation, summarization, and transformation.
- **Aggregated Analysis**: Compute summary statistics and identify significant trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots to visualize sales trends and customer demographics.

## Key Features

- **Large Dataset Handling**: Worked with a synthetic dataset containing 1 million transactions to mimic real-world data size.
- **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Imputed missing values and handled outliers using statistical methods.
- **Data Generation Script**: Included a script to generate the dataset, allowing for reproducibility.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn for enhanced plotting.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized into functions for clarity and reusability.
- **Aggregated Insights**: Performed group-by operations and pivot tables for in-depth analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

- Mastered data cleaning techniques for handling missing and anomalous data in large datasets.
- Gained experience in data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy.
- Performed statistical analysis and interpreted results.
- Created advanced visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Learned how to generate synthetic datasets for simulation and testing purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- Use real e-commerce data from open data sources.
- Incorporate machine learning models for sales prediction.
- Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit.
- Perform customer segmentation analysis.

## Acknowledgment

Some parts of this project, such as initial code drafts and optimization suggestions, were assisted by AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. However, I have ensured a deep understanding of the core functionality and refined the code to suit my learning objectives.
