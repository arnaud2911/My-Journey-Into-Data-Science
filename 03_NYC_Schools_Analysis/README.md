# NYC Schools Analysis

## Project Description

This capstone project analyzes NYC schools' SAT performance to identify the best-performing schools and boroughs. It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps to provide insights into the educational landscape of New York City.

## Objectives

- Identify schools with the best math results (at least 80% of the maximum possible score).
- Determine the top 10 performing schools based on combined SAT scores.
- Find the borough with the largest standard deviation in combined SAT scores: highlight the number of schools, and the mean and standard deviation of it's combined SAT score.
- Perform data cleaning and visualization to enhance the analysis.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculating key statistics and identifying trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to illustrate findings.
- **Modular Code**: Organized functions for each analysis step.

## Acknowledgment
Some parts of this project, such as initial code drafts and optimization suggestions, were assisted by AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. However, I have ensured a deep understanding of the core functionality and refined the code to suit my learning objectives.
