# Customer Review Processing

## Project Description
This project processes a list of customer reviews by escaping special characters, such as quotation marks, and replacing newline characters with spaces. The processed reviews are then concatenated into a single string, separated by " || ", and written to a text file for further use.

## Objectives
- Process customer reviews to escape special characters and flatten the text.
- Concatenate the processed reviews into a single string.
- Write the concatenated reviews to a text file.

## Key Features
- String manipulation using Python's `replace()` method.
- Concatenation of lists into a single string with a custom delimiter.
- Writing processed data into a file for further use.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practice string manipulation using Python's built-in methods.
- Understand how to concatenate and process data in lists.
- Gain experience with file handling in Python.

## Future Enhancements
- Read reviews from a file and process them dynamically.
- Add input validation to handle empty or malformed reviews.
- Extend the project to handle larger datasets.

## Acknowledgment
Some parts of this project, such as initial code drafts and optimization suggestions, were assisted by AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. However, I have ensured a deep understanding of the core functionality and refined the code to suit my learning objectives.


## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/My-Journey-To-Data-Science.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd My-Journey-To-Data-Science/02_Customer_Review_Processing
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python customer_review_processing.py
    ```

4. The processed reviews will be printed to the console and saved in `processed_reviews.txt`.
