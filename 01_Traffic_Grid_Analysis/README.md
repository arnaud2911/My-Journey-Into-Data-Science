# Traffic Grid Analysis

This project simulates traffic flow in a city grid and performs various analyses, such as calculating the total number of vehicles, identifying intersections with the highest traffic, and transposing the grid. Additionally, it allows user input for grid size and vehicle count range, visualizes traffic density, and processes real traffic data from external sources.

## Objectives

- **Initialize** a traffic grid with random vehicle counts.
- **Print** the grid in a formatted manner.
- **Calculate** the total number of vehicles.
- **Identify** intersections with the highest traffic.
- **Transpose** the grid.
- **Visualize** traffic density using heatmaps.
- **Process** real traffic data from external sources.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate** to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd My-Journey-Into-Data-Science/01_Traffic_Grid_Analysis
