# My Journey Into Data Science

Welcome to my collection of projects documenting my journey to becoming a Data Scientist. Each project showcases different concepts and skills I've learned along the way.

## Projects

1. [Traffic Grid Analysis](./01_Traffic_Grid_Analysis)
   - **Description**: This project simulates traffic flow in a city grid and performs various analyses, such as calculating the total number of vehicles, identifying intersections with the highest traffic, and visualizing traffic density.
   - **Key Concepts**: 2D lists, nested loops, data analysis, function decomposition, data visualization, real data integration.

2. [Customer Review Processing](./02_Customer_Review_Processing)
   - **Description**: This project processes customer reviews by flattening newline characters and escaping quotation marks, then concatenates them into a single string. The results are written to a text file for further analysis.
   - **Key Concepts**: String manipulation, file handling, list processing, text data cleaning.

3. [NYC Schools Analysis](./03_NYC_Schools_Analysis)
   - **Description**: This capstone project analyzes NYC schools' SAT performance to identify the best-performing schools and boroughs. It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps to provide insights into the educational landscape of New York City.
   - **Key Concepts**: Data cleaning, data analysis, pandas, numpy, data visualization, matplotlib, statistical analysis, code modularization.

4. [Stock Price Analysis and Simulation](./04_Stock_Price_Analysis)
   - **Description**: This capstone project analyzes and cleans a large stock price dataset of a fictional company over a **20-year period**. It handles missing values and anomalies, calculates daily returns, performs statistical analysis, and simulates future stock prices using a random walk model. The project demonstrates data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and statistical concepts in a real-life data science scenario.
   - **Key Concepts**: Large dataset handling, data cleaning, data manipulation, pandas, numpy, data visualization, matplotlib, seaborn, statistical analysis, random simulation, code modularization.
